# Airline Connectivity Analysis using DSU Rollback

## Overview

This project implements a **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) with Rollback** to analyze connectivity in an airline route network. Airports are represented as vertices and flight routes as graph edges. The DSU structure efficiently manages connected components, while the rollback feature restores previous network states after temporary changes.

## Problem Statement

Airline networks frequently experience route additions and removals. The objective is to determine whether two airports remain connected after specific route modifications without rebuilding the entire network.

## Features

* Disjoint Set Union (DSU) implementation
* Union-by-Rank optimization
* Connectivity checking
* Rollback functionality
* Dynamic graph connectivity analysis
* Efficient network management

## Sample Output

```

## Time Complexity

| Operation | Complexity |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Find      | O(log n)   |
| Union     | O(log n)   |
| Rollback  | O(1)       |

## Applications

* Airline Route Networks
* Transportation Systems
* Communication Networks
* Dynamic Connectivity Problems
* Infrastructure Monitoring

## Conclusion

The DSU Rollback technique efficiently manages dynamic connectivity queries by allowing previous network states to be restored without rebuilding the graph. This makes it suitable for airline, transportation, and large-scale network analysis systems.
